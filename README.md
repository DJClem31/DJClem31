- 👋 Hi, I'm DJClem, experimental gamer on Minecraft and Paladium (despite the big problem that it lags with my 8 year old laptop) and 3D modeler.
- 👀 I'm interested in Minecraft development, design and modeling of video games.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to code Minecraft mods and develop several games on different platforms.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on medium level projects with Youtubers and pro players on Minecraft.
- 📫 You can reach me by pro mail at the following address: djclem31@gmail.com
- 💻 I thank you for donating to buy my first gaming setup to improve the quality of my developments but also the gaming quality to play big greedy games such as Minecraft on server or Paladium. Here is the link of the donations: www.lepotcommun.fr/pot/88da0p1x-donsdjclem
